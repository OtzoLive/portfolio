**TLDR:** I finally started creating my own portfolio website to showcase all my projects. It's built with Astro, Tailwind, and hosted on Vercel. Today I focused on creating a design doc, building a basic layout with placeholders, and figuring out how to make my site unique.

## The start of a never ending process...

Hi! I'm John. 

Currently I work as a Data Analyst but I'm working towards becoming a Front End Developer with a focus on UX Design.

My goal by making my own portfolio website is not to just showcase my projects, but to document my thought and design process behind each one. This is how I work normally so it just makes sense to include it. My portfolio is the start of a very long process as I plan to update it monthly with my works.

My main goals are to make sure I:

* Create something unique that isnâ€™t just copy pasted UI components from the internet
* Stand out as a frontend developer (is this even possible?)
* Work on it regularly and keep it updated
* Focus on mobile first design
* Include documentation on how the site was created

## Standing out

I love design. Specifically the user experience. Everytime I use a new product I am immediately thinking about why it is the way it is. Could it be easier to use? This seems like a poor choice this for design, why did they decide to do it this way?

To try and showcase that, I decided my portfolio should include my design docs, thought processes, and iterations of the websites design. My guess is no one would read or look through 20 photos of the same website looking different each time.

That's when I thought: 
>Why not just build this into the website in an interactive way?

Or put another way, include buttons that allow the user to quickly swap between design iterations of the website itself. Each time they click the button, the whole website transforms back into an older (or newer) version of itself.

That way I can show how the website has come together over time in a fun and interesting way, without subjecting visitors to a boring slideshow of UI components.

Before that can even happen, I need to actually create a first version, so I figured out what I wanted to include:

#### Website Layout

| Web Page   | Description    | 
| --------  | -------- | 
| Home | Where the user lands, first impressions count!| 
| Blog | Central place for all my blog posts |
| Portfolio | List of all my projects to explore |
| About Me | List my contacts and a bit about myself |

Then I determined what I wanted to use to build it:

#### Tech Stack

| Tech   | For    | Why   |
| --------  | -------- | ------ |
| Astro | Web Framework | Easy SSR and great for content |
| Tailwind | CSS | Cause normal css is a pain |
| Vercel | Hosting | Free and asy push from GitHub |
| Typescript | Language | Because I need to learn it |

And finally I could start building a site with some placeholders! My first go-around has a ton of placeholders so I could build something quick and dirty. The next challenge is figuring out how my unique website transformations will work before I get too far ahead. I don't want to have to rebuild everything just because it doesn't work.

## Closing

I hope this first blog post provided some insite into what I hope to accomplish and how I went about planning for it. I plan on posting monthly updates that include future updates, design documents, screenshots, and more.

Take care!
